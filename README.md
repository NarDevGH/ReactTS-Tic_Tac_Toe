Introductory project from the React documentation page:

#### TODO:

- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
